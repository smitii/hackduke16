Our virtual world, currently called "Holidays around the World", will take a child on a journey through various cultural celebrations across the globe and help them learn some fundamental details. There are interactive challenges after every cultural lesson to engage the young user and solidify his or her learning. At our starting stage right now, we describe Eid only, but plan to expand our reach to other celebrations as time permits.
